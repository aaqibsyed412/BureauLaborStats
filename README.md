In this project, I used Snowflake to analyze U.S. unemployment trends: national rates from 1976-2025, state averages from the past year, and sector trends in manufacturing, retail, construction, and healthcare. I wrote SQL queries to extract insights, visualized results in Snowsight, and showcased cloud-based data analysis.
